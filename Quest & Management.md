# Quest and Update Management System

## Quests Management

1. **Quest Creation**:
   - Quests are typically stored in the database (MongoDB in this case).
   - An admin panel or API endpoint (protected, admin-only) is usually created for adding new quests.

2. **Quest Types**:
   - Daily Quests: Reset every 24 hours
   - Weekly Quests: Reset every 7 days
   - Special Event Quests: Time-limited quests for special events

3. **Automated Quest Updates**:
   - A scheduled job (cron job) runs at specific intervals to:
     - Deactivate expired quests
     - Activate new daily/weekly quests
     - Check and update quest progress for all users

4. **Quest Progress Tracking**:
   - User activities (taps, upgrades, etc.) trigger progress updates for relevant quests.
   - When a quest is completed, rewards are automatically distributed to the user.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of how quest updates might be implemented:

```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const Quest = require('./models/Quest');
const User = require('./models/User');

// Run every day at midnight
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
  try {
    // Deactivate expired quests
    await Quest.updateMany(
      { expiresAt: { $lt: new Date() } },
      { $set: { active: false } }
    );

    // Activate new daily quests
    const newDailyQuests = [
      { title: 'Tap 100 times', reward: 50, type: 'daily' },
      { title: 'Upgrade GPU once', reward: 100, type: 'daily' },
      // ... more quests
    ];

    for (let quest of newDailyQuests) {
      await Quest.create({
        ...quest,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
        active: true
      });
    }

    // Update quest progress for all users
    const users = await User.find({});
    for (let user of users) {
      // Logic to update quest progress based on user's activity
      // ...
    }

    console.log('Daily quest update completed');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating quests:', error);
  }
});
```

## Other Updates

1. **Game Balance Updates**:
   - Adjustments to game mechanics (e.g., tapping rewards, upgrade costs) are typically done through configuration files or database entries.
   - These can be updated through admin API endpoints or directly in the database.

2. **New Features**:
   - Major updates involving new features usually require code changes and redeployment.
   - A versioning system for the API can help manage backwards compatibility.

3. **Content Updates**:
   - New items, achievements, or other content can be added through admin interfaces or API endpoints.

4. **User Notifications**:
   - Important updates can be communicated to users through in-app notifications or Telegram messages.

## Best Practices

1. **Testing**: All updates should be thoroughly tested in a staging environment before being applied to production.
2. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan to quickly revert changes if issues are discovered post-update.
3. **Gradual Rollout**: For major changes, consider rolling out to a small percentage of users first.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to quickly identify any issues post-update.
5. **User Feedback**: Provide channels for users to report issues or give feedback on new features and quests.
